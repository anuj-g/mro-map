## Mro Map

<img src="https://raw.github.com/mapmeld/mro-map/master/screenshot.png"/>

This is the code and data behind the first-of-its-kind interactive map of Bangladesh in Mro language. Mro is written in a script which
is not yet officially encoded for computers, so making a map is tricky.

The map is under development and will gradually get more detailed, more accurate in transliteration,
and hopefully include local content and placenames. I am working with actual language experts
on this one.
